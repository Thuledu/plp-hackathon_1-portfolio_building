This project is a website built strictly using HTML, CSS and a little javascript.
It is a beginner-friendly website page about recipes.
It consists of:
A Home page: which has a Lemon Meringue Tart recipe.
An About Us page: which just describes what the overall website is about.
A Contact Us page: which has a form to fill in your name, email and message.

It's a website that can gradually, overtime - be updated and modified...
